This is a java library for doing Keygen for the WebID protocol.
This provides the java classes a server can use to respond
to <keygen> spkac requests, IEs ActiveX equivalent, and
Netscape's javascrip version (needed for servers that only produce
xhtml).

The WebID protocol is explained in detail at
