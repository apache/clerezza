Thomas Jefferson, the leading Enlightenment figure in the United States, along with Benjamin Franklin, who took exactly
the same view, argued that dependence will lead to "subservience and venality", and will "suffocate[s] the germs of
virtue". And remember, by dependence he meant wage labor, which was considered an abomination under classical liberal
principles.
