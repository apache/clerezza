<p>Author: Tommaso Teofili</p>

<h2 id="list">1. Install UIMA bundles</h2>

<p>

</p>

<h2 id="install">2. Install Clerezza - UIMA utils bundles</h2>

<p>
</p>

<h2 id="start">3. Install Metadata Generator bundle</h2>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    Now you can use the UIMABaseMetadataGenerator, for example you could bind such a generator to Discobit Editor to
