          <dc:description>Chuck Baril is a native of Detroit, Michigan, and it was there on New Year’s Eve in 1975 when his destiny was set. At the Pontiac Silverdome, Elvis performed an amazing concert to an audience of 60,000 screaming fans along with one young impressionable young man who decided that night that he too would become a singer. He began singing as a young child and has sung and recorded many styles of music over the years. Three of the songs he has written and recorded have been played on 90 radio stations in 11 states. But Chuck has come back to his first love, Elvis’ recordings, because that is what he loves most and does best.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Been performing Elvis tribute shows for 10 yrs. Having been in the music business for twenty years Duke knows how to please the audience. Duke started doing his tribute shows after several request from the audience members to do more and more of Elvis' songs and a request for him to do an Elvis Tribute Show. Duke has been asked several times if he is lip-syching to Elvis' songs and the answer is absolutely NO. The sound and stage presence is so close to 'The King' that it has startled many.</dc:description>

Dano was also a seven year member of a classic rock band and often contributed an Elvis act that audiences always truly enjoyed. Starting in February, 2004 he has performed in many solo shows for benefits, auctions, various parties , a Theme Park, as well as much time donated to entertain the elderly. He uses quality audio equipment with great sounding background tracks. Longer travel distances will be considered. Contact Dano today if you want your next party 'all shook up'!!!</dc:description>

Countless fans have described his act as containing the very spirit of Elvis. Tim</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Steve Connolly's million dollar Las Vegas production show on the Strip at Bally's convinced many he was the Best Elvis Impersonator. Elvis's original backup singers, The Jordanaires, caught the show and were overwhelmed ( see website). The Las Vegas Press, and the LA Times both declared that Steve was the Ultimate in Elvis Entertainment. In fact, Bobby Morris, Elvis's first conductor at the Hilton said that Steve was truly the Best Impressionist of Elvis. So why does Steve Connolly - a songwriter,musician, art school graduate, and church muralist decide to do an Elvis Tribute? Steve puts it this way: 'Elvis Presley was a performer whose music can still top the charts today in country and pop. In fact,Leonard Bernstein, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Bono of U2, and even Bob Dylan all declare that Elvis is the ultimate 20th Century American cultural icon. So, if my mission is to entertain audiences as completely as possible, why not re-create a COMPLETE experience of Elvis Presley's performance so that audiences experience not just the music of Elvis Presley but grasp the total 'Spirit of the King.'' Given that motive, Steve decided to PERFORM with all of the athleticism, musical virtuosity, humor, and sexual energy of Elvis at his most vital (think ' 68 comeback special - black leather and guitar). Since Steve is also an accomplished guitarist, the response to this style of Elvis entertainment in Las Vegas has been exceptional. Over 3,000 performances at the MGM, Riviera, Caesar's, Alladin, Bellagio, Bally's, and Fitzgerald's. Too many film and TV appearances to mention. Even today Steve remains the only entertainer depicting Elvis to have his own show run daily in a major room (the Jubilee Theater) at a major Strip Casino (Bally's 1999 show 'Love Him Tender'). The Bally's show led longtime Las Vegas entertainment writer Joe Delaney to note how Steve was capable of fully entertaining the audience even as a humorist in Elvis's style and was in fact 'perhaps the best of the Elvis depictors.' Fans of Steve's version of Elvis Entertainment include well-known musicians: Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Kenny Loggins, Mic Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac and Paul Revere of the Raiders. All have publicly recognized Steve as the 'Best Elvis' entertainer. In 1999 Steve won the 'Super Bowl' of Elvis contests in Las Vegas: officially giving him the title, 'Best Elvis in Las Vegas'. In 2003 Steve Connolly was selected by the prestigious Berklee School of Music to perform his Tribute to a sold out crowd - a first for an Elvis Impersonator! Just recently Steve was inspired by his experience with Elvis's music to write his own songs recorded on his CD, 'Truth' and released nationally. It has sold several thousand copies in only six months. Unfortunately, Elvis himself can not be with us for a live performance but Steve Connolly can bring the spirit of the experience to you for an unforgettable event.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Brad has the looks, the moves and the voice -- that’s why he is the #1 Elvis Tribute Artist in Pennsylvania. Brad has won awards in every competition he has entered. He recently performed three packed shows at Carlisle First Night New Year's Eve event. In addition to numerous performances throughout Pennsylvania, Brad has performed in places such as Branson Misouri, Key West Florida, and Shanghai China, as well as other locations throughout the U.S. When Brad hits the stage, his strong vocals and top showmanship skills are a guaranteed crowd pleaser. With bona fide outfits, genuine Elvis style hair and sideburns, and a 3-1/2 octave vocal range, this act is truly a fitting tribute to the King. Brad’s performances are so authentic that his jumpsuits were even created by the costume designers of the Warner Brothers film, 3000 Miles to Graceland! Best known locally as the leader and drummer of the veteran band, East Coast Invasion (now known as ECI Rock), Brad has been honing his Presley tribute show for three years. He has been singing Elvis songs since the days of the original King in the 1960s. Unlike other performers who may do impersonations for laughs or lip sync Elvis’ hits, Brad is the real deal and insists on singing Elvis’ music straight. Brad creates a unique show each time and no two shows are the same.</dc:description>
