<h1>Usage of Apache UIMA integration within Clerezza </h1>

<p>Author: Tommaso Teofili</p>

<p>Date: July 27, 2010</p>

<p>You can use one of this package modules to take advantage of the Apache Unstructured Information Management
    Architecture framework to enable discover and annotation of entities within text nodes of GraphNodes</p>
<h4>UIMA - Clerezza available modules:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Metadata generator - this module is a particular implementation of the MetadataGenerator interface which
        provides extraction of entities from a resource depending on its media type. It recognizes tags and language to
        associate to the uploaded GraphNode and creates a new Graph containing the whole UIMA extracted structures
    </li>
    <li>Concept tagging - this module enables UIMA as a ConceptProvider for automatic concept tag suggestion</li>
    <li>Utils - utility classes to be used when some module wants to call UIMA and its services as a Clerezza bundle</li>
    <li>Ontologies - the ontology responsible to describe UIMA type system, annotations and features relationships</li>
</ul>
