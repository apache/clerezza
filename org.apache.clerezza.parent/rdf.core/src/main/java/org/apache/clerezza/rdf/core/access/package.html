		<p>This package provides access to named {@link
			org.apache.clerezza.rdf.model.Graph}S and {@link
			org.apache.clerezza.rdf.model.MGraph}S that may originate from various
			implementations.</p>
		<h3>Accessing</h3>
		<p>
			If running in a dependency injection system you should get an instance
			of
			<code>TcManager</code>
			by the framework, otherwise use the static method
			<code>TcManager.getInstance</code>
			.
		</p>
		<h3>Adding a provider</h3>
		<p>A provider implements {@link WeightedTcProvider}.</p>
		<p>
			To work outside a component injection framework it contains a file
			<code>META-INF/services/org.apache.clerezza.rdf.model.access.WeightedTcProvider</code>
			containing the name of the implementing class.
		</p>
		<p>
			To work in a OSGi-DS context the provider register a component
			exposing
			<code>org.apache.clerezza.rdf.model.access.WeightedTcProvider</code>
			as service interface.
		</p>
