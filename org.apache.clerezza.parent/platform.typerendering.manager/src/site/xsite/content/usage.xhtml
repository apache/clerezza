		<h1>Usage: How to use the the Renderlet Manager</h1>

		<h2 id="list">1. List Renderlets</h2>
		<p>
			The renderlet manager allows renderlets for rendering resources of a certain type to be defined as well as setting and changing the priority of the renderlets. An overview of the installed renderlets can be found under <a href="http://[your.server]/admin/renderlet-manager/overview" target="_blank">http://[your.server]/admin/renderlet-manager/overview</a>. <br />
            The renderlets are prioritized (The topmost is the first renderlet of the list). Use the links to "up" or "down" to change the order.
		</p>
		<h2 id="upload">2. Upload a Renderlet</h2>
		<p>
            You can install a renderlet via <a href="http://[your.server]/admin/renderlet-manager/install-renderlet-form" target="_blank">http://[your.server]/admin/renderlet-manager/install-renderlet-form</a>. <br />
        </p>

            That's all. Enjoy.
